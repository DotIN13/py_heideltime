# py_heideltime
py_heideltime is a python wrapper for the multilingual temporal tagger HeidelTime.

For more information about this temporal tagger, please visit the Heideltime Java standalone version: https://github.com/HeidelTime/heideltime

This wrapper has been developed by Jorge Mendes under the supervision of [Professor Ricardo Campos](http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/) in the scope of the Final Project of the Computer Science degree at the [Polytechnic Institute of Tomar](http://portal2.ipt.pt/), Portugal.

Although there already exist some python models for Heideltime (in particular https://github.com/amineabdaoui/python-heideltime) all of them require a considerable intervention from the user side. In this project, we aim to overcome some of these limitations. Our aim was four-fold:

 - To provide a multi-platform (windows, Linux, Mac Os);
 - To make it user friendly not only in terms of installation but also in its usage;
 - To make it lightweight without compromising its behavior;
